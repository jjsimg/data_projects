# data_projects
This repository represents 3 data sets that I chose to work on to become more familiar with scikit-learn found in Python. The first data set focuses on bank marketing, the second data set represents student performance in two different classes (mathematics, Portuguese), and the final data set is a technical spec on various automotive vehicles.
